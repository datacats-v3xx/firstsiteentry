# Jewelry E-commerce Security Incident Response

## Overview

This repository documents a security incident response conducted on a compromised jewelry e-commerce platform. The investigation uncovered an active exploitation using a webshell uploaded through a path traversal vulnerability in a legacy CakePHP component. The report outlines our methodology, findings, and stealth remediation techniques that neutralized the threat without disrupting the site's operations.

## Case Study Contents

- **Incident_Response_Report.md**: Anonymized documentation of the security incident
- **Technical_Analysis/**: Detailed analysis of discovered payloads and exploitation techniques
- **IOCs/**: Indicators of Compromise for threat hunting
- **WAF_Enhancements/**: Documentation of Web Application Firewall improvements

## Key Features of This Investigation

1. **Stealth Response Methodology**: Neutralizing active threats without alerting attackers
2. **WAF Enhancement Approach**: Improving security controls rather than disruptive remediation
3. **Advanced Obfuscation Analysis**: Deobfuscation of sophisticated evasion techniques
4. **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Correlation of observed techniques to the MITRE framework

## Investigation Timeline

The investigation followed a systematic process:
1. Initial discovery of suspicious endpoints
2. Identification of the vulnerable component
3. Analysis of attacker payloads and obfuscation techniques
4. Testing and verification of exploitation methods
5. Enhancement of WAF protections
6. Validation of security improvements

## Critical Vulnerabilities

This case study documents:
1. **Path Traversal in File Upload**: Allowing attackers to place files anywhere on the filesystem
2. **Improper Input Validation**: Direct use of user input without sanitization
3. **Legacy Component Exploitation**: Abandoned code providing attack surface
4. **WAF Evasion Techniques**: Sophisticated obfuscation to bypass security controls

## Technical Highlights

- Detailed analysis of obfuscated JavaScript and PHP payloads
- Documentation of WAF bypass techniques using function splitting and encoding
- Extensive use of forensic methodologies to trace attack path
- Non-disruptive remediation strategy through WAF enhancements

## Intended Audience

This case study is designed for:
- **Security Professionals**: Methodology for stealth incident response
- **Web Developers**: Understanding of how legacy components create risk
- **Security Researchers**: Examples of real-world WAF evasion techniques
- **System Administrators**: Approaches to reducing attack surface

Each section contains both detailed technical analysis and "Plain English/TL;DR" summaries to make the content accessible to technical and non-technical readers alike.

## Ethical Considerations

All investigation activities were conducted:
- With strict adherence to ethical guidelines
- Without violating laws or causing service disruption
- Using minimal-impact testing methods
- While maintaining complete anonymization of the affected business
- Following responsible security practices

## Attribution Analysis

The report includes limited attribution assessment based on observed techniques. The attacker demonstrated moderate sophistication with:
- Multi-layer encoding to evade detection
- Extension and filename spoofing
- Advanced WAF evasion through function splitting
- Timestamp and permission manipulation

## Research Contributions

This case study contributes to the security community by documenting:
1. Real-world WAF evasion techniques in active exploitation
2. Effective stealth remediation strategies
3. Methodology for incident response with minimal operational impact
4. Analysis of obfuscation techniques in the wild
